# dv-extracredit

The readme file will contain the instructions for your created assignment. It should follow the format and style of the readme files for homeworks #2 and #3, and include the following:

A title for your assignment
Add a short introduction describing the purpose of the assignment. In other words: what D3-related things you will learn by completing this assignment?
Also add a bulleted list of the basic activities you'll do for the assignment.
If necessary, add a brief description of the dataset and any pre-processing or wrangling that is required.
Then, in detail, describe the specific steps that a student should take to complete the assignment. Each Step should have its own section (Step 1: blah blah, Step 2: blah blah, etc.). You can use homeworks #2 and #3 as a guide. In these Steps, you should write out the specific code modifications that are required to go from the starter code in the template file to the code in the completed folder.
You must have a minimum of four steps in your assignment.
If desired, you can include hints and reminders along the way.
You should also include a minimum of 3 screenshots of your assignment in the readme (as is done in Homework #2). Screenshots can be placed in the images/ folder and referenced in the readme file at the appropriate places.
Gifs that show interactions/animations are also allowed instead of static images.
One of your screenshots should be a picture of the completed/working assignment.
Make sure you reference your images in the readme correctly!
